Researcher in conservation planning. My research focuses on developing new approaches to solving various conservation planning problems, with an emphasis on reducing habitat fragmentation and improving ecological connectivity. Specifically, I use techniques from combinatorial optimization and constraint programming to address non-linear aspects of conservation planning (e.g. habitat fragmentation). I developed most of these research issues in my [PhD thesis](https://agritrop.cirad.fr/599126). I also applied them for the conservation and restoration of New Caledonian forests.

# Current project

I am currently working as a postdoc in the ADMIRE project in New Caledonia, with the New Caledonian Institute of Agronomy and the AMAP Lab.
