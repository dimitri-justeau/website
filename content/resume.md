#### **PhD candidate** at **Cirad/IAC**, *October 2017 - Today (Montpellier/Nouméa, France/New-Caledonia)*.

Since October 2017 I am proud to be a PhD candidate with the GAIA doctoral school at the University of Montpellier. I am hosted by the AMAP joint research unit and funded by the [Cirad](http://www.cirad.fr/en/home-page) and the [IAC](http://www.iac.nc/) (New Caledonian Institute of Agronomy). You can find more details about my subject [here]({{< relref "about.md" >}}).

#### **Freelance developper**, *February 2017 - October 2017*.

Between February 2017 and October 2017 I worked as a freelance developper. I first worked with the NGO [Solthis](https://www.solthis.org/en/) on the development of a flexible tool for generating monthly HIV follow-up reports in Niger. I then worked with the [IAC](http://www.iac.nc/) on the prototyping of an online geographic analysis tool, that I afterwards integrated into [Niamoto](https://niamoto.io/), the ecological information system I designed during my two-years previous mission with the IAC.

#### **Ecoinformatics computer scientist** at **IAC**, *February 2015 - February 2017 (Nouméa, New Caledonia)*.

I worked two years with the [IAC](http://www.iac.nc/) as an ecoinformatics computer scientist. My work focused on the development of tools of optimizing the field data collections and on the design and the development of [Niamoto](https://niamoto.io/), an ecological information system for decision support, focused on New Caledonian forest habitats.

#### **Sanitary information systems project manager assistant** at **Solthis**, *October 2013 - December 2014 (Conakry, Guinea)*.

From October 2013 to December 2014, I worked with the NGO [Solthis](https://www.solthis.org/en/) in Guinea. I trained and mentored doctors and pharmacians on the usage of the new national tools for collecting and analysing HIV follow-up data. I also developped a software for generating monthly HIV follow-up reports from a Fuchia database, and a software for storing and analysing those reports.
