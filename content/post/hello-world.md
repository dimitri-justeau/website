## Welcome in my PhD blog!

Since we have to begin somewhere, this is the first post of my PhD blog. In October 2017, I started a PhD whose subject is *"A Global and flexible approach for modeling and solving the reserve selection problem"*. This is an interdisciplinary project which lies at the crossroad between **applied mathematics**, **computer science** and **conservation biology**. I am candidate with the [**GAIA**](https://www.adum.fr/as/ed/gaia/) doctoral school at the [**University of Montpellier**](http://www.umontpellier.fr/university-of-montpellier). I am hosted by the [**AMAP**](http://amap.cirad.fr/en/) joint research unit, and I split my time between its french implantation in **Montpellier**, its new caledonian implantation in **Noum√©a**, and the [**TASC**](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/ppc/index_en.html) research team in **Nantes**. My PhD is funded by the [**Cirad**](http://www.cirad.fr/en/home-page) and the [**IAC**](http://www.iac.nc/). Finally, My PhD directors are [**Philippe Birnbaum**](http://amap-collaboratif.cirad.fr/pages_chercheurs/index.php?page=philippe-birnbaum) (Cirad/AMAP, Botany and forest ecology) and [**Xavier Lorca**](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/xlorca/Monsite/Bienvenue.html) (IMT Atlantique/LS2N, Graph theory and constraint programming).

I think that writing about your work is great, and sharing it is even better. In research, we solve different types of problems every day: finding a good reference about a particular topic, learning how to use a library, how to build a PhD blog, finding useful tricks for the field, etc. Writing about this is a good way to cristalize this day-to-day knowledge, and sharing it on the internet is a way to help others that could face the same kind of problems. Actually, this is what a huge part of the internet is about: *sharing human knowledge and practices*.

Beyond that aspect, I also see the PhD blog as a way to keep a written and shared trace of the PhD experience, which is, from what I have seen around me (I am only starting mine), something intense in a scientist's life.
