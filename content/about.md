Hello internet visitor! I'm Dimitri, a PhD candidate with the [**GAIA**](https://www.adum.fr/as/ed/gaia/) doctoral school at the [**University of Montpellier**](http://www.umontpellier.fr/university-of-montpellier). I am hosted by the [**AMAP**](http://amap.cirad.fr/en/) joint research unit, and I split my time between its french implantation in **Montpellier**, its new caledonian implantation in **Nouméa**, and the [**TASC**](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/ppc/index_en.html) research team in **Nantes**. My PhD is funded by the [**Cirad**](http://www.cirad.fr/en/home-page) and the [**IAC**](http://www.iac.nc/). My PhD directors are [**Philippe Birnbaum**](http://amap-collaboratif.cirad.fr/pages_chercheurs/index.php?page=philippe-birnbaum) (Cirad/AMAP, Botany and forest ecology) and [**Xavier Lorca**](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/xlorca/Monsite/Bienvenue.html) (IMT Atlantique/LS2N, Graph theory and constraint programming).

My subject, *"A Global and flexible approach for modeling and solving the reserve selection problem"*, lies at the crossroad between **applied mathematics**, **computer science** and **conservation biology**. My research focuses on designing new methods for solving spatial conservation problems, with an emphasis on how real life constraints can be precisely represented. I am currently interested in studying how **graph theory** and **constraint programming** can provide answers to this question. I am also working with **ecologists** and **decision makers** between France and New Caledonia to have a better understanding of the environmental, social and economic issues implied by reserve selection. **New caledonian rainforests** is the main ecosystem in which my methods are tested.

I am always interested in collaborating with researchers and practitioners. In particular, if you have experience with reserve selection models and spatial conservation planning, feel free to [contact me](mailto:dimitri.justeau@gmail.com)!
