      <description>In this post we will see how to convert a single shapefile containing vector features of several classes (where the class is stored as an attribute of the features) to multiple single-class presence-absence rasters, one for each class. More concretely, we have one shapefile containing a bunch of vector features, representing many classes. For each class, we want to extract one single band presence-absence raster, that is a raster where a pixel equals 1 if there is an vector of this class overlapping it, 0 else.</description>

      <description>Welcome in my PhD blog! Since we have to begin somewhere, this is the first post of my PhD blog. In October 2017, I started a PhD whose subject is &amp;ldquo;A Global and flexible approach for modeling and solving the reserve selection problem&amp;rdquo;. This is an interdisciplinary project which lies at the crossroad between applied mathematics, computer science and conservation biology. I am candidate with the GAIA doctoral school at the University of Montpellier.</description>

      <description>Hello internet visitor! I&amp;rsquo;m Dimitri, a PhD candidate with the GAIA doctoral school at the University of Montpellier. I am hosted by the AMAP joint research unit, and I split my time between its french implantation in Montpellier, its new caledonian implantation in Nouméa, and the TASC research team in Nantes. My PhD is funded by the Cirad and the IAC. My PhD directors are Philippe Birnbaum (Cirad/AMAP, Botany and forest ecology) and Xavier Lorca (IMT Atlantique/LS2N, Graph theory and constraint programming).</description>
